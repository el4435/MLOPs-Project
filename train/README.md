# Taxi Driver Event Time & Location Prediction â€” Model Training

This folder trains a random forest model to predict how many trips will be requested from a certain location within a 15 minute time frame. The model uses MLFlow to travk experiments.

## How to run the model

1. **Run the main.py notebook and ssh into the given session a local terminal**

2. **Compose the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f MLOPs-Project/train/docker-compose.yaml up -d
   ```

3. **Find the token and subsitute the IP address with the floating IP:**
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```
